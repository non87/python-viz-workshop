    "# Data Viz with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome. This is the first part of the Data Visualization with Matplotlib Workshop. This is a part 1 of 4. Before starting, let's discuss the structure and objective of the workshop in the general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will focus on the basics of `matplotlib`, which is the most popular visualization library in Python. After the workshop you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the basic (object oriented) syntax of `matplotlib`;\n",
    "2. Be able to create scatterplots and histograms with `matplotlib`;\n",
    "3. Be able to understand the `matplotlib` documentation and Stackoverflow discussions about more advanced plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `matplotlib`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is extremely powerful, but also somewhat cumbersome to work with. The great amount of control over each component of the plot comes at the cost of a rather complex syntax and multiple lines of codes to achieve the desired results. For example, in this workshop we will always use at least 2 lines of code to create even the simplest plot. So, why teaching `matplotlib` in an introductory workshop about data visualization in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, `matplotlib` is the backend of most data visualization in Python. Lighter/ simpler visualization from packages such as `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Geopandas`, `Arviz`, `statsmodel`, `OSMnx` (to cite packages I personally used) uses `matplotlib` as its backend. Chances are that you will eventually need to tweak the standard plots you get out of this packages -- for example, for publication purposes. To do this, you will need to know how `matplotlib` works. Moreover, you can use `maptlotlib` for new kinds of visualization. For example, [I use it to visualize of (and create animation from) soccer data](https://github.com/non87/OOPitch/blob/main/examples/Read%20and%20Visualize%20Data.ipynb). That is, knowing `matplotlib` really opens the door to advanced-level visualization in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop is divided into 3 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Syntax and Objects\n",
    "2. Introduction to Plotting\n",
    "3. Histograms, scatterplots\n",
    "4. How to save a plot in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 and 2 are pre-requisites for the remaining parts as they introduce the basic structure of a `matplotlib` plot. Make sure you get through them before proceeding.\n",
