    "# Data Viz with Matplotlib 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome. This is the first part of the Data Visualization with Matplotlib Workshop. This is a part 1 of 4. Before starting, let's discuss the structure and objective of the workshop in the general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will focus on the basics of `matplotlib`, which is the most popular visualization library in Python. After the workshop you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the basic (object oriented) syntax of `matplotlib`;\n",
    "2. Be able to create scatterplots and histograms with `matplotlib`;\n",
    "3. Be able to understand the `matplotlib` documentation and Stackoverflow discussions about more advanced plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `matplotlib`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is extremely powerful, but also somewhat cumbersome to work with. The great amount of control over each component of the plot comes at the cost of a rather complex syntax and multiple lines of codes to achieve the desired results. For example, in this workshop we will always use at least 2 lines of code to create even the simplest plot. So, why teaching `matplotlib` in an introductory workshop about data visualization in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, `matplotlib` is the backend of most data visualization in Python. Lighter/ simpler visualization from packages such as `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Geopandas`, `Arviz`, `statsmodel`, `OSMnx` (to cite packages I personally used) uses `matplotlib` as its backend. Chances are that you will eventually need to tweak the standard plots you get out of this packages -- for example, for publication purposes. To do this, you will need to know how `matplotlib` works. Moreover, you can use `maptlotlib` for new kinds of visualization. For example, [I use it to visualize of (and create animation from) soccer data](https://github.com/non87/OOPitch/blob/main/examples/Read%20and%20Visualize%20Data.ipynb). That is, learning `matplotlib` really opens the door to advanced-level visualization in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop is divided into 5 main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Syntax and Objects\n",
    "2. Introduction to plotting\n",
    "3. Scatterplots\n",
    "4. Histograms\n",
    "5. How to save a plot in a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 and 2 are pre-requisites for the remaining parts as they introduce the basic structure of a `matplotlib` plot. Make sure you get through them before proceeding.\n",

    "## Part 1: Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with importing some useful packages. We will be working with three packages: **numpy** , **pandas** and **matplotlib**. The main focus will be on matplotlib and data visualization, but numpy and pandas are great packages to handle data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with importing. Here we immediately encounter our first difficulty: this is a notebook. Matplotlib has some peculiar behaviour inside notebooks. It is time to introduce the idea of _backend_ and how matplotlib manages its _backend_ differently inside a notebook. Unfortunately, we have to discuss this before importing matplotlib, because this has to be set immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quoting from the <a href=https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend>matplotlib official documentation</a>:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">The “frontend” is the user facing code, i.e., the plotting code, whereas the “backend” does all the hard work behind-the-scenes to make the figure. There are two types of backends: user interface backends (for use in pygtk, wxpython, tkinter, qt4, or macosx; also referred to as “interactive backends”) and hardcopy backends to make image files (PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as “non-interactive backends”).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a backend transforms code into a figure. There are different options to do this, with the main difference being between the hard and the interactive modes. Indeed, a backend will either save the final product on a file ( _hard backend_ ), such as a png file, or show you the plot on screen ( _interactive backend_ ). \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is smart and will select a working backend for you most of the time. Therefore, you will hardly ever notice -- especially if you just want to save a figure in an external file. However, it is important we check how backends work because the code you write and the behavior of matplotlib will change implictly depending on how you are running your code (notebook, live coding, or script). To write code that reliably produces the results you want, knowing the basics of matplotlib backends is fundamental. For example, how do we translate notebook code to script code?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of the backends available in my machine within this Conda environment -- your list may differ. Notice, we have not even imported `matplotlib` yet."

In the last workshop, we will also focus on using interactive backends in a non-notebook environment. The `inline` backend will show the figures just below the cell where they are created. The basic rule you have to follow when plotting in notebooks:  **One cell, one plot**. Depending on your coding style this may or may not be a big deal. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this backend, we will use a <a href=\"https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html#magics-explained\">magic function</a> of Ipython (official name!). In general, you can recognize a magic function because it is preceded by `%` -- the line above was a magic function already. However, magic functions will only work in a notebook -- use the function `matplotlib.use()` to change backend outside notebooks."
